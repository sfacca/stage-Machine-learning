# Tutorial - distributedFBA.jl

This tutorial serves as a reference to get started with `distributedFBA.jl`. Download the live notebook from [here](https://github.com/opencobra/COBRA.jl/tree/master/tutorials).

If you are not familiar with `COBRA.jl`, or how `COBRA.jl` should be installed, please refer to the tutorial on `COBRA.jl`.


```julia
using COBRA
```

## Adding local workers

The connection functions are given in `connect.jl`, which, if a parallel version is desired, must be included separately:


```julia
using Distributed #leejm516: This is needed even though COBRA imports that package 
include(joinpath(dirname(pathof(COBRA)), "connect.jl"))
```

You may add local workers as follows:


```julia
# specify the total number of parallel workers
nWorkers = 4 

# create a parallel pool
workersPool, nWorkers = createPool(nWorkers) 
```

The IDs of the respective workers are given in `workersPool`, and the number of local workers is stored in `nWorkers`.

In order to be able to use the `COBRA` module on all connected workers, you must invoke:


```julia
@everywhere using COBRA;
```

## Define and change the COBRA solver

Before the COBRA solver can be defined, the solver parameters and configuration must be loaded after having set the `solverName` (solver must be installed):

- `:GLPKMathProgInterface`
- `:CPLEX`
- `:Gurobi`


```julia
# specify the solver name
solverName = :GLPKMathProgInterface

# include the solver configuration file
include(joinpath(dirname(pathof(COBRA)), "../config/solverCfg.jl"))
```

The name of the solver can be changed as follows:


```julia
# change the COBRA solver
solver = changeCobraSolver(solverName, solParams)
```

where `solParams` is an array with the definition of the solver parameters.

## Load a COBRA model

As a test and as an example, the *E.coli* core model may be loaded as:


```julia
# download the test model
using HTTP
include(joinpath(dirname(pathof(COBRA)), "../test/getTestmodel.jl"))
getTestModel()
```

Load the stoichiometric matrix S from a MATLAB `structure` named model in the specified .mat file


```julia
model = loadModel("ecoli_core_model.mat", "S", "model");
```

where `S` is the name of the field of the stoichiometric matrix and `model` is the name of the model. Note the semicolon that suppresses the ouput of `model`.


## Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)

In order to run a flux balance analysis (FBA), `distributedFBA` can be invoked with only 1 reaction and without an extra condition:


```julia
# set the reaction list (only one reaction)
rxnsList = 13

# select the reaction optimization mode
#  0: only minimization
#  1: only maximization
#  2: maximization and minimization
rxnsOptMode = 1

# launch the distributedFBA process with only 1 reaction on 1 worker
minFlux, maxFlux  = distributedFBA(model, solver, nWorkers=1, rxnsList=rxnsList, rxnsOptMode=rxnsOptMode);
```

where the reaction number `13` is solved. Note that the no extra conditions are added to the model (last function argument is `false`). The minimum flux and maximum flux can hence be listed as:


```julia
maxFlux[rxnsList]
```

## Flux Variability Analysis (FVA)

In order to run a common flux variability analysis (FVA), `distributedFBA` can be invoked with all reactions as follows:


```julia
# launch the distributedFBA process with all reactions
minFlux, maxFlux, optSol, fbaSol, fvamin, fvamax = distributedFBA(model, solver, nWorkers=4, optPercentage=90.0, preFBA=true);
```

The optimal solution of the original FBA problem can be retrieved with:


```julia
optSol
```

The corresponding solution vector `maxFlux` of the original FBA that is solved with:


```julia
fbaSol
```

The minimum and maximum fluxes of each reaction are in:


```julia
maxFlux
```

The flux vectors of all the reactions are stored in `fvamin` and `fvamax`.


```julia
fvamin
```


```julia
fvamax
```

## DistributedFBA of distinct reactions

You may now input several reactions with various `rxnsOptMode` values to run specific optimization problems.


```julia
rxnsList = [1; 18; 10; 20:30; 90; 93; 95]
rxnsOptMode = [0; 1; 2; 2 .+ zeros(Int, length(20:30)); 2; 1; 0]

# run only a few reactions with rxnsOptMode and rxnsList
# distributedFBA(model, solver, nWorkers, optPercentage, objective, rxnsList, strategy, preFBA, rxnsOptMode)
minFlux, maxFlux, optSol, fbaSol, fvamin, fvamax, statussolmin, statussolmax = distributedFBA(model, solver);
```

Note that the reactions can be input as an unordered list.

## Saving the variables

You can save the output of `distributedFBA` by using:


```julia
saveDistributedFBA("results.mat")
```

Note that the results are saved in a `.mat` file that can be opened in MATLAB for further processing.

## Cleanup

In order to cleanup the files generated during this tutorial, you can remove the files using:


```julia
rm("ecoli_core_model.mat")
rm("results.mat")
```
